Problem Statement
Mental health management of people has become increasingly important. It is an essential factor for living a good life. Unfortunately, consulting a doctor for non-life-threatening problems can be difficult at times due to busy lives. The taint associated with psychiatric disorders makes people not seek any help. Since mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, It affects how we think, feel, and act. So the people must be able to determine how to handle stress and make healthy choices. 

This project proposes a framework of mental health chatbots that is based on the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy methodology. CBT is a form of talking therapy designed to manage mental health states by rearranging the way the patient perceives it, i.e., making negative thoughts positive. 
The NLP algorithm performs sentiment analysis to detect trigger words, performs intent classification, select the most probable response and handle the flow of conversation. This version of chatbots enhance its convenience for use and help people learn more about their mental health and take bettercare of their well-being in these challenging times that have significantly impacted our day-to-day lives. The chatbot is an anonymous companion. It has the potential to be a useful tool for individuals with mental stress, especially those who are reluctant to seek mental health advice due to stigmatization. Chatbot aims to make lives easier and to improve the quality of life.

Vision
Our chatbot will provide a supportive presence to service users, engaging them with the conversation at times when they feel low. This chatbot will simply provide a friendly ear. A place to air concerns, worries, intrusive thoughts or engage in ‘therapeutic’ small talk. The chatbot uses this conversational input to detect the mood of the service user and respond with empathy. The chatbot will also provide guidance or advice to help users challenge their negative thoughts.

Impact
“Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.”-Kathleen Kara Fitzpatrick, Alison Darcy, Molly Vierhile, in a study published in JMIR Mental Health. The main use aim of this chatbot is to support people with depressive symptoms or clinical anxiety. Though it can’t treat these disorders directly, it can offer ‘always-on’ alleviating help. Modelling tactics from behavioural therapy can encourage users to accept their emotions.So, these chatbots will offer relevant tools and resources to help users find healthy coping strategies. (Spanning anything from meditation to mental exercises, to self-help, etc.
